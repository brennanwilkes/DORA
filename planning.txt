Abstract
 6-7 sentences, 150-250 words
 gist of paper
 prepares for full paper
 remember key points

Key Points:
	DORA metrics of Open Source Repos are not representative of the greater software industry
	Most open source projects have significant room for improvement in devops
	Major version releases are brutal ??
	High performing projects are appreciated by the community
	Change failure rate is not a useful metric

	Lifecycle:
		Deployment frequency slightly increases (Ultra and High start level with medium, then increase)
		Lead Time slightly increases (Ultra and High are consistent, Others vary wildly)
		Mean time to recover linearly increases
		Change Failure Rate slightly decreases (Everyone starts with bugs)


	Averages over Time:
		Deployment frequency is increasing linearly since 2012
		Lead Time for changes stayed constant / Slightly decreased (Terrible and Low vary wildly)
		Mean Time to Recover increasing linearly since 2012 (Terrible vary wildly)
		Change Failure Rate increased slightly since 2008, decreased slightly since 2017


Mine:
deploymentFrequency
Elite		>= 1 time per day
High		>= 2 times per week
Medium		>= 1 time per week
Low			>= 1 time per month
Ultra Low	The rest

leadTimeForChanges
Elite		>= 1 day
High		>= 1 week
Medium		>= 1 month
Low			>= 1 year
Ultra Low	The rest

meanTimeToRecover
Elite		>= 1 week
High		>= 1 month
Medium		>= 3 months
Low			>= 1 year
Ultra Low	The rest

changeFailureRate
Elite		>= 10%
High		>= 30%
Medium		>= 50%
Low			>= 90%
Ultra Low	The rest
